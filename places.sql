So she gets to dr hearns office, they call her back, got her vital signs etc. Dr Hearne came in and spoke with her about her visit. My friend told him that another doctor she sees referred her to him. Before she could even get to her symptoms, Dr Hearn steps out and tells her that he would look up her information. About five minutes later, he returned and asked how old she was. She told him 32 and he stepped out again. A few minutes after that, his wife comes in and tell my friend, \" Your records show that you are receiving pain medicine from four different doctors so Dr Hearn will not be seeing you. Please leave\". My friend wasn\'t even there for prescriptions. She simply wanted to get to the root of some serious symptoms she has been having. She felt so humiliated and offended. She said they treated her like a crack head or dope fiend. The wife stood there, waited for her to gather her belongings, and escorted her out!

There are many people who want to help you and are willing to help you. Do NOT be afraid to seek help, there is no shame in trying to seek treatment for yourself. 40 million Americans suffer from some form of depression. That is 40 million out of 300 million people. You are not alone nor do you need to suffer silently. Getting a card can help, but remember treating the root cause will help you in the long term. That will take some work, but again there are many people who care about you and will help you, you just seek the help and you will find it.\n\nBefore you think it, YES you are worth it. NO, your not a burden, NOR should you ever feel guilty for seeking help!\nDepression and anxiety can be as debilitating as any physical disease.

You can achieve balance in both, and there are many ways to do it. This place offers one way. But it\'s certainly not the only way nor should you ONLY use this method.

They are also easy to share as that is atmosphere on the bus. Anyway, back on the bus, we light one up, seems to be burning fine. Exhale, and.... nothing? My husband and I tried 3 times each, plenty off smoke coming off the cherry but none getting to our lungs. Thinking maybe we are just idiots who don\'t know how to smoke a joint as we usually use glass pieces, we pass it down for other people to try. No one got a hit out of it. Thinking maybe we just got a dud, we lit up a second one with the same results. We then tried tearing off the filter, same result. We finally just gave up and threw it in a cup of water. We ended up leaving the rest of the pack in our hotel room for the maid to find.

Wonderful people like the lady at the front desk are few and far between here in Colorado Springs, being as kind, compassionate, and empathetic as she was.

Keep doing what you are doing, and hopefully more people will pick up your attitude and demeanor when dealing with fellow human beings.\n\nThere are many people that are in need of the help that medical marijuana can provide, so please understand that this place can get very busy at times, especially after 420 weekend.  They normally operate on a first come, first serve basis so be aware that you may spend some time here even if you have an appointment.

I ended up with a nice variety of strains to try for my husband and a wonderful little journal to keep track of which strains worked best for his problem.

I have scoliosis, a pinched nerve, bulging disc and calcium buildup forming spinal fusion, all in my lower back. I did NOT want to get hooked on heavy pain killers like Oxy or anything full of Acetaminophen as all of these are very addictive and destroy your internal organs, especially  your liver and kidneys. I was lucky enough to meet Paul and discuss the benefits of Medicinal THC as an alternative to pain. He showed me several different options of e-cig/vapor pens (disposable and rechargeable.)  I spoke with my primary doctor (who had already offered to get my my State THC Card) and he agreed it was the best option. So I visited the Honolulu Wellness Center and was very impressed. Their on-site MD went through a thorough series of questions and tests and approved me for my card. Once I received it from the state in less than 2 weeks, I started using the vapor pen for my constant pain (I live at a minimum pain level of 4 and some days its an 8). \nAfter Paul took extensive time to tell me about the different strains and Indica vs Sativa, the level of \"high\" I would experience with each. I explained to him that I did not like feeling \"high\" and had not smoked any THC in 20 years as it made me paranoid (20 years ago). Paul selected 2 different options for me to try and I can\'t say how amazed I was. I only take 2-3 small hits off the pen around 7:00pm when my back is always at its worst from sitting down in a chair all day at work. \nThe vape pen not only did a better job of any prescription meds I\'ve been given for the past 3 years, I also did not have any overwhelming of feeling high. No paranoia, no \"over thinking\" or anything else negative.\nIt was a fully positive experience. It also made me sleep very well and without any of the groggy side effects I got in the morning when I took a prescription pain meds.\nTHIS IS ALL 100% my true experience!! I\'ve been using The Honolulu Wellness Center\'s medicinal help for 4 months now. I\'m back in the Gym, I\'ve lost 22 pounds because I\'m not tired from prescription pain meds and can exercise again. I\'ve even started doing Sunset Yoga near the Waikiki Aquarium. I can honestly say that it\'s changed my life for the better. I don\'t smoke during the day, but on the rare occasions that my pain level is high during the day, I take one small toke off the vape pen and no pain, but also no high with just one 2 second pull on the vapor THC pen.\nThank you VERY much Honolulu Wellness Center and Paul Klink for helping me change my life. I\'m 45 years old, have my six pack abs back and veins in my biceps and shoulders. I promise this is all true. I can\'t tell you just how amazing my life is now that I\'m not drugged out on Oxy or other pain meds.\nMahalo Paul!!!', 1510261451),

Even though you can see the waiting room from the purchasing room it made me feel comfortable knowing someone wanted to help look after them. Making sure a patient has access to the medicine they need and they feel safe is their top priority, and they definitely do that.\nI was able to take my time and pick out the things that I needed and did not feel rushed into making a purchase from the budtenders. Some are patients themselves and were able to offer their person opinion on strains I was interested in trying. They had a diverse selection of products and had several affordable options to help patients get the medicine that they need. I would have liked to see a few more CBD products in flower and Concentrate, but this is an issue that is found across the state. The few CBD products that they did have were amazing strains, and I have now doubt in my mind that they will attempt to expand this selection as well.\nThis is the only minority owned dispensary that I know of in the state, and they have a few bilingual staff to help reach out to the Spanish speaking community. If you are in the south side of Chicago you need to check out Mission IL.

I usually just call and tell EarthMed what happened and I  have them exchange it for the same product. \n\nI recently witnessed a well maintained employee dealing with a disgruntled patient by the front door. I heard the patient walking away complaining she had to drive over 3 hours to be unsuccessful in whatever it is she was dealing with. The employee softly spoke to another employee explaining that JR was disheartening to be dealing with such a situation moments before closing and to start off the weekend. I got the feeling he was probably yelled at by the patient. But without focus he turned around with a smile on his face greeting me and making me feel good. He made some suggestions of varieties of items I was looking for.

I live in town here and am 8 years experienced with smoking but initially went to Canuvo in Biddoford an hour away due to reviews about Remedys management. Once I got myself established there with a dosing of CBD that really managed my issues I decided to try Remedys oil since they\'re so much closer. Was initially impressed with the atmosphere and the building but that certainly does not compensate now that I\'ve had my experience. I purchased their olive oil CBD (made with a strain called shark something or other - not a known potent CBD strain) and a gram of their super saver bud which is over $14 a gram! $15 for their regular menu!! The flower had SEEDS in it and is still sitting in a drawer because it\'s ditch weed basically. I gagged on the first dose of oil and ended up in the ER after switching dispensaries. The oil also solidifies in the fridge! When confronted with this information I was told that I didn\'t dose correctly and that it works for many other patients. So basically there was no accountability or genuine empathy about my experience. This really upset me and I left completely dejected. \nNeedless to say I went back to Canuvo! $10 a gram for consistently very good quality bud that gets tested more than Remedy. They aren\'t just in it for the THC money making game, sucking money off of people dealing with physical pain management. Their edibles (brownies, etc) are also 3x cheaper than this place!! Canuvo is more professional and secure. They also don\'t SCAN YOUR LISCENCE. They have a couple CBD strains and numerous others CONSISTENTLY on deck. The oil is made with a potent AC/DC strain, always, and the oil tastes/feels great. Made out of coconut oil so it absorbs quicker. Even with tolls, gas and time; it is cheaper and well worth going elsewhere. Definitely will keep passing the word around.', 1524004475),

I was on 2 medications along with 30 mg more than the average dose of Buspirone for anxiety, totalling 90 mg, and still felt the physical sensation that comes with anxiety. I am a professional musician so I had anxiety with performance as well.  I am now off of the Buspirone and the CBD oil has taken away all of the physical feeling of anxiety unless it is near time for a dose of CBD oil. Even then, when I take the dose the anxiety disappears within minutes. I am now performing on my own without a family member there in support because of the lack of anxiety.  My friends have noticed and mentioned my moods are even and stable and my concentration on daily tasks is much longer than before the CannaBiDiol oil. The last 15 years of my life have been plagued by the pharmaceutical industry, however, now I can say that medical marijuana, CBD oil, are changing my life for the better!!

As, according to Maryland law, I then had to wait a few weeks for the certification to be approved by the state and a number to be assigned to me; and, when that arrived via email, Integrative Physicians contacted me and the prescription was written, and usable, on that same day. The experience couldn\'t have been better, leading me to write this review of praise, and wonder if a previous reviewer before me even went to the same business. I highly recommend Integrative Physicians for their quick and compassionate service...and, btw, there was no pee test, nor either the hint of one, for me or my friend who was also certified there.

Cannabis needs to be \'burped\' or breathe to encourage the curing process and assure the cannabis doesn\'t become musty. Dropping a moisture package in a batch and storing it away is not effective because the moisture package can only take on so much moisture, then the remaining excess moisture begins to destroy the medicine you have worked so hard to produce.

But when I go to the counter to ask for the edible i wanted he went to get it and it was out of stock. I had to ask for at least 3 items that were not there but listed on the menu.

He suspected the person I was driving with had committed a minor traffic incident and he accused us of causing it and took video footage from the shop, which turned out to be rather inconclusive and only showed a little scuff mark on his car - aka no damage. We are paying for whatever the repair estimate turns out to be because if we had thought we had actually damaged someone\'s car we would have offered to pay anyway. However, the accident itself isn\'t the issue, it\'s the fact that my personal information was given away without permission along with shop video footage, and this person went so far as to track me down.

For those on their first visit, you will see others that seemingly came in after you that go in before you. These are just people picking up & do not affect the wait time for first visit counseling. I saw another review complaining about that, but I don’t think they realized there is a difference between basic pick up & first time visits so keep that in mind your first time there.  Also, if you want to speed up your pick up, just give them a call before you head out so they know you’re coming & can have what you need ready. \nSTAFF – the people here are AMAZING. They are not only super kind & understanding, but they are all very well educated on all topics relating to medical marijuana so if you have any questions at all they are more than capable of handling it. I really can’t express enough how welcoming this place is.\nPRODUCT – Although their inventory may be a bit limited from time to time, their strains & quality of the flower are fantastic. \nPRICE – Since this is only my first dispensary, I don’t have much to compare it to, but other reviewers say it can be a bit pricey.  I don’t have a problem with the pricing especially since it’s as good as it is. \nPARKING – This can be kind of tricky if you’re trying to get on the main road. However there is a side street right across from the shop & on that block is a metered parking lot that even takes credit/debit cards. If you don’t want to pay at a meter, if you just go over a few blocks on the side street there is 2 hour parking for free. \nI totally recommend checking out this dispensary.', 1526924940),

I\'ve been a patient for two years and did not feel I got the attention or respect I deserved. \n\nThe front desk staff:\n-Unfriendly, rude, very stand off-ish\n-Will keep you on hold (phone) for an extended period of time (10-15m+)\n-Will not ever admit they are at fault or take ownership of a mistake (front desk, nurses, and doctor)\n-Everything falls under a \"policy\" and there is no budge/wiggle room no matter what the extraneous circumstances are\n\nWaiting room:\n-You schedule an appointment, show up on time, but you wait for 30 minutes. I\'m not sure what the hold up is, but this is not the greatest experience from the patients perspective.\n\nDoctor:\n-Moves quickly, talks quickly, doesn\'t take time to slow down and explain things calmly to you\n\nOther Notes:\n-It is a 100% Polish staff\n-Majority of other reviews appear to be from the Polish community (take everything with a grain of salt)\n\nSummary:\nEveryone is looking for a doctor who will listen to you, checkup on your general health, consult with you on your concerns, give you a proper prognosis, and most importantly, make you feel comfortable. \n\nIn my experiences with Dr Tadeusz, I feel like I didn\'t receive any of these items except for checking off the items on his list of \"general health\" concerns. \n\nAt every corner, the guy was trying to up-sell me on vanity services that they offer. If you go in for a physical, be prepared for blood tests, urine, lung test, EKG, and a sonogram. I am young and healthy, no need for a lot of this, but I figured, hey, better safe than sorry and if the doctor suggests it, why not?\n\nThis doctor also does medical marijuana licenses, botox, chiropractic services, neurology services, and a wide variety of other beauty and non-beauty services. Yet it is a small practice. What I\'m getting at, is that they seem to be after that paycheck to pump patients in and out through the cash cow and then up-sell to the patients that will take the bait on their extra services. \n\nI got royally upset when someone on the medical staff made a mistake and forgot to submit my requested test and would not admit fault. The reason why I got so upset is because I had to specifically sign extra paperwork and had discussions with the nurse and the doctor about the test I had requested. The doctor mentioned that the insurance would not cover the cost in my consultation and I said I want to do it anyway because it\'s for my health. The doctor had no recollection of this and he stated that a \"new policy\" was issued to them from the insurance (in the two weeks that had passed) saying that my insurance wouldn\'t cover the test, and instead of calling me to ask me if I wanted to proceed, they \"didn\'t put it through.\" In reality, someone forgot to put it through, didn\'t fill out the paperwork properly, and it never got done. If they had took responsibility for it and been frank with me, I would have felt better about the situation. If what he said was true, then he should have called me up to notify me that the insurance would not cover it and just double check that I would be okay with the expense. But in my experience, Doctors typically don\'t have a problem with putting this on the patient because we sign paperwork saying that if the insurance company doesn\'t cover the expense, we (the patient) are liable for the expense. \n\nI will never come back to this practice. I would advise anyone who is in good health to avoid this practice. To the sick, good luck, I would pick another doctor.', 1522266601),

Sure, there were gleaming steel-and-glass towers all around me, but this was an old building with an unmarked entrance. Am I at the right place? I checked the address as given on the website over and and before I took the elevator to the 3rd floor to find myself in the entry area of a surprisingly nice co-working space called Colab. The nice gentleman working at the front asked with a smile what I was looking for and I told him that I was looking for Dr. Oliver Park. He led me in to where his office was and I met the nice young doctor. I have a chronic ankle pain that has frustrated me over the past decade. It started as something I considered a mid-level sports injury; now it is something that actually figures in my decision making for strenuous activities. In a hustle-and-bustle city like ours that involves constant stair climbing, ankle pain can be just shy of debilitating. Having exhausted all other options (or seemingly so) I begrudgingly decided that I would consult a medical marijuana physician. Dr. Park was so thorough (and he kept insisting that I call him Oliver) and utterly patient with my page-long list of questions that I thought to myself that perhaps I should begin going to doctors more often. My favourite part of the experience was that even though his website stated (and he reiterated almost as soon as I got there) that he will not charge for the consultation that doesn\'t result in a certification, he did not try to push me to get one; Oliver made me feel cared for as a patient and not at all pressured. \nI have little doubt that many out there with real pains and ailments like myself are on the fence about medical marijuana. I strongly recommend you take the step to visit Dr. Oliver Park at Cannabis MD and get a consultation. It\'ll be worth your time, at the least, to become informed.

Today assured that they are now on my never return list. The issue always seems to revolve around bait and switch. First they advertise sale products they don\'t have then try and up sale you. I went in today after getting the email. Karma Cookies 12 dollars. So I schlep over first thing, we don\'t have that flavor. Bud tender recommended a chocolate bar, twice I asked if it was the same price as the cookies and he said yes both times. It was 8 dollars more than the cookie. I said wait, I don\'t want this for 20 dollars. Honestly I can do better price wise, another dispensery has 300 mg for 23$ why would I pay 20$ for 200 mg? So after we straightened that out I said I\'ll take my second choice for the cookie. We\'d been talking about how I use indica for sleep. He came back said he had a indica cookie. Great, I\'ll take it. He failed to mention that it was 5 dollars more than the other cookies. They offered to take it back, but the issue is I don\'t drive, I am disabled, it\'s litterally 2 hours round trip on the bus. Not much they could offer me to make the trip again. Way to many options for dispenseries here. Prior to hitting Urban Wellness, I stopped by another dispensery for a 40 dollar quarter of 20 percent THC flower. \n Way to many choices to put up with this. With dispenseries offering quality bud for anywhere from 6 to 8 dollars,  this place looks worse and worse. Just received 3 email blasts, one dispensery having several strains at 6 dollars a gram, another dispensery with a 7 dollar gram, a 8 dollar gram and 9 dollar grams. As someone else pointed out their 4/20 was nothing really. While other dispenseries gave out free pro rolled, or 18 dollar 8ths or BOGO. Urban Wellness didn\'t offer much. \nI\'m sure there are people who love this place, I\'m not among them.\nUpdated 5/16. This typifies Urban Wellness. At 3 pm I get a call, goes to voice mail, no message. When I get home I dial the number it\'s Urban Wellness. I say someone called me from this number.

The affirmative defense is a real law, and this is real protection against prosecution for your medication. 4. If you have never been to a dispensary, your life will forever change as soon as you walk through the door of one especially a top ranked one. 5. The center is only 45 minutes from the dispensaries. You can go straight there as soon as you walk out the door. 6. You become somewhat humbled by seeing people with real health issues finally getting the medication they deserve. Then you realize it\'s finally happening to you, too. I am on my 3rd card.\n\nCons: 1. It\'s kind of on the pricey side for some at first. Expect to pay roughly $250-$275 out the door card in hand. In all honesty though, it\'s worth it. Buy your meds in bulk and get your money back that way. Places like Holistic Health Wayne have $30/gram extracts and $125/oz deals. 2. The card is only valid for 90 days. After the 90 days is up it\'s $125 to renew rather than full price.\n\nI would recommend anyone do this.', 1523306787),

The bud quality is good but tends to be overpriced compared to other dispensaries with the same product. I tend to stick to flower so I couldn\'t comment much on the other products in the shop. They have some cool glass to look at as well. Being a third generation Bendite, I like all of the local stuff they tend to advertise.\n   The reason I am giving them 2 stars is because of the average nature of the shop and declining quality of service. If I want something cheap, there\'s cheaper. If I want something good, there\'s better. The last few times I have been in as well, there are customers literally leaving the shop due to lack of adequate service. My fiancee and I watched 3 groups of customers behind us walk out just today. 3 potential clients, due to nothing other than lack of motivated and active employees. There were 3 employees working (very slowly) at the time but only 1 helping customers. The others looked to be counting or pricing products in cases, even after acknowledging that customers were in line with eye contact. \n   After 10 minutes on a watch and no service to anyone, we were the 4th group to leave (a 5th group walked in and instantly out as we were driving out of the parking lot). This is no doubt a horrible business strategy as well as there are multiple dispensaries within two blocks of them that are less expensive and more prompt.

They answered all of the questions I had and even sat me down 1 on 1 with a counselor after I got approved by the Dr. The counselor is very helpful. He will go over your rights as a caretaker as well as your rights as a patient. If you want to get into medicinal marijuana the right way, this is the way to go!\nI wouldn\'t recommend anyone else!

This came out of nowhere - I bought my cartridge on Saturday, it broke last night when I went to use it and when I went into Summit today after work there was a sign up about the cartridges saying no refunds or exchanges effective immediately. \n\nInteresting how there were no signs on Saturday mentioning this might be an issue and suddenly this new rule is being enforced where you can\'t get a replacement for a defective item. When I mentioned that it\'s obviously a manufacturing issue if it\'s a prominent problem where they now have to advertise about it I was told \"it\'s not, I just had a long meeting about it today. If it was a manufacturing issue they would have caught it before it got to the stores. It\'s happened randomly in the past.\" Right, so if it has happened randomly and is suddenly happening frequently enough that you have to advertise checking all cartridges before leaving the store, then it sounds like a manufacturing issue. \n\nNevermind the fact that Summit\'s stance on this is that the consumer is breaking the cartridges. If it\'s that easy to break, 1. Why are you selling it in your store? 2. Then wouldn\'t it seem plausible that the company making them messed up this particular batch? \n\nThe manager didn\'t want to hear it. Need I remind everyone that this is NOT a recreational facility, this is a medicinal compassion center - not subsidized by insurance - so that $40 I spent on Saturday for a medicinal cartridge that subsequently broke on me, is just thrown in the trash. And this facility couldn\'t care less. Instead of being treated with typical customer service I was spoken to like a toddler - \"well it\'s glass, you have to be really careful with it\". \n\nSeriously?! This isn\'t my first cartridge- I\'ve purchased many, traveled with them, accidentally knocked them against my nightstand, and never had an issue. My first cartridge to break, at a time when a lot of other cartridges are breaking, is obviously a manufacturing issue and is instead being treated as the result of cartridges being mishandled by the consumers. Right. Okay. Meanwhile, upon closer inspection of the pieces of this cartridge the glass wasn\'t even cut straight to fit into the screw bottom. That would explain it- defective glass cutting leads to cartridges falling apart. But, hey, what do I know? Good job losing a regular customer.', 1525142055),

Even though they have my name, and number, in their system, and they know you must have a CO ID to get a med card, they would not serve me. The first budtender asked me to wait while he checked if he could accept it. I heard their conversation and the first thing he said was “Look when it was issued”. I may be wrong but the expiration date is the only date that should matter if a person if of legal age. After 5 minutes of indecisiveness, the guy sitting behind the window  came and told me he could not take it. He then proceeded to show me a state of CO issued notice of acceptable ID. When I pointed out the paper he was showing me did not say that an out of state was not acceptable, he said “Well we use this for both med and recreational, so..” So I left, and went to another store and they had no issue with my legal ID. Much cheaper, just a bit out of my way but well worth it. \n\nI won’t be returning to this store.

Seems they would rather you physically go there than to save fuel with a phone call, for questions. Most seem to be from out of state with years of professional experience.\n\nYou invest in their brands and styles, but don\'t really know what you\'ve buying, until you try to use it. No samples, or refunds. If something isn\'t good, you\'re just out of luck, because you have to buy the large size to find out. The child proof cap leaked and it was all wasted anyway. I\'ve had vape cartridges leak or arrive empty (Surterra), but the prescription limit doesn\'t consider any of that. \'Wellness\'? \'Compassion\'?

Instead of actually doing it, we get hybrids of oils that are ineffective, while paying top dollar just to try it.

She is competent and compassionate.  I have never felt rushed in her office.  She takes the time to hear your diagnosis, current treatment, and symptoms that are concerning to the patient.  With her extensive training and knowledge of medical cannabis she informs the patient of various methods of administration, dosing information, and the expected results.  She shares information on all of the FL dispensaries available to the patient.  Dr. Beasley also shares information about saving money as some dispensaries have points earned for discounts on future purchases.  Her fees are fair, especially for the level of service provided.  \nWith Dr. Beasley\'s guidance I\'ve been able to cut back on pain medication by 25%.  Unexpected benefits (not supported by research, just my personal experience) my blood pressure has been lowered significantly, enough to stop blood pressure medicine. Additionally, my blood sugar is under control and diabetic meds were stopped.  Note: this has been under close supervision with my physicians.\nLastly, when I\'ve told my doctors that Dr. Beasley is supervising my use of cannabis they know her and say they feel secure in her knowledge, skills, and abilities. I really appreciate her efforts to educate our area physicians about the benefits of cannabis in the treatment of chronic pain. To know my doctors respect her speaks volumes!', 1527721612),

Well what doctor needs to earn $100 in 10 minutes with no healing involved whatsoever? I get that they have fixed costs. It’s still too much. Especially when people are getting approved for things like “low appetite.” I could barely eat my Big Mac last night because it was so nasty, so let me go get a medical marijuana card. He also questioned my knowledge of economics and accused me of staying home all day and smoking weed, which may or may not be accurate, but you should never say this to a customer. One day, this scam will die when marijuana is legalized. \n\nThe management replied to review stating that the end result of this is that the patient receives “specially produced medicine.” In Seattle you can buy, directly off the shelf, exactly what they are selling in these so called medical dispensaries, but over there they don’t bother with pretentious labels. No, the entire system truly is a scam to get money into the pockets of clever business tycoons and Rick Scott.  \n—\n\nTook me six months to realize it was kind of a scam. It took about five minutes for the doctor to decide I was eligible for medical. Actually before the doctor even came in the nurse said I seemed eligible. \n\nSix months down the road my prescription expires. They want $99 to renew it. The doctor who barely looked at me and signed me up. \n\nSo you’re asking me to pay you $150, the state $100, and $100 every six months.. to buy weed. Please jump into the nearest lake. \n\nAlso for a month after I signed up they would not answer the phone. Not sure why. Had to call five locations to get someone to pick up.\n\nPlaces like this are just a temporary middle man until recreational is legalized. Making tons of money off of people who want to get high. Meanwhile the dispensaries have extremely limited options, have lines out the door (thanks to literally anyone being accepted into the program), and I NEVER RECEIVED MY CARD.

I am not a recreational marijuana user, and she was able to educate me extremely well about what she thought would work best for my particular illness and what options I had.. and wow there is a LOT of them. I am so very pleased with both of them, very kind and helpful people. They were very professional, informative, and I left feeling very relieved to finally get another alternative to the pain pills and nerve-blockers I have been taking for my autoimmune disorder. I submitted my application to the state today, and will update on how long it takes the state to send me a card (told it typically takes 4-6 weeks). But yes, I highly recommend them. They are located inside the big chiropractic building. \n\nUPDATE: I got my medical marijuana card 25 days after submitting my application to the state; pretty quick and painless. If you are in chronic pain and looking for another way to manage it besides pills and \'just dealing with it\', PLEASE do yourself a favor and look into medical cannabis.
